## Key Observations

1. **Very low search volume for specific terms** – The exact phrases "xml feed validator", "xmlfeed validator", and "google xmlfeed validator" have only ~10 searches/month. The compound term "xmlfeed" (one word) likely has zero volume.

2. **High CPC despite low volume** – The niche terms have premium CPCs ($24-25) indicating commercial intent and competition from advertisers despite low search volume.

3. **Broader terms dominate** – "xml validator" at 6,600/month is where the volume is, but this is very generic and not specific to product/shopping feeds.

4. **RSS feed validator** has decent volume (880/month) but high keyword difficulty (82).

5. **Declining trend** – Most keywords show a -30% to -50% yearly decline, suggesting the tool category is mature or consolidating.

**Bottom line:** There's not much search demand specifically for "xml feed checker/validator" terms. If you're considering building content or a tool around this, you'd either need to target the broader "xml validator" terms and capture product feed users as a subset, or focus on longer-tail product-specific terms like "google shopping feed errors" or "product feed troubleshooting" which might have different keyword patterns.
